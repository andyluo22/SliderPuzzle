# SliderPuzzle ðŸ§©
## The Problem
The slider puzzle is a game that is played on either a 3-by-3 grid or 4-by-4 grid, with 8 square tiles labelled 1 through 8 or 15 square tiles labelled 1 through 15 respectively.  The **objective** of the gain is to rearrange the initial set of tiles so that they are in row-major order - using as few moves as possible.  With some rules, the player can only move the tiles either **horizontally** or **vertically** into the blank square.

### Significance 
To solve the slider puzzle in an elegant way, an implementation of the A* algorithm - which is a general artifical intelligence methodology - to find the most efficient path to the goal board.  This implementation utilizes a priority queue and a minimum heap tree to efficiently  


#### Heuristic Function 


#### Detecting Unsolvable Boards


#### Optimization of Space Complecity and Time Complexity
